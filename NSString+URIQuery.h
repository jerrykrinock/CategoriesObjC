/*!
 @brief    Constants used to define the standard which specifies
 the set of characters to be percent-escaped encoded in the 
 encoding methods of NSString+URIQuery.
 
 @details  Encoding is based on CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes.
 The documentation of CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes
 says that it escapes characters which are "not legal URL characters
 (based on RFC 2396)".  However, the word "legal" does not appear in
 RFC 2396, and in fact there are several categories of characters.
 
 So, I did an experiment to find out which ASCII characters are encoded,
 by encoding a string with all the nonalphanumeric characters available on the
 Macintosh keyboard, with and without the shift key down, and feeding this
 into CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes.  The result was that fourteen
 characters were encoded:  ` # % ^ [ ] { } \ | " < > SPACE_CHARACTER
 This agrees with the union of the lists of "space" "delims" and "unwise" in
 RFC 2396 sec. 2.4.3.  So I assume that this is what Apple means by "not legal".
 Also, I found that all of the non-ASCII characters available on the Macintosh 
 keyboard by using option or shift+option are also encoded.  Some of these have
 two bytes of unicode to encode, for example %C2%A4 for 0xC2A4.

 Therefore, the constant SSYPercentEscapeStandardRFC2396 means the
 character set defined by the union of the following sets:
 * The fourteen characters  ` # % ^ [ ] { } \ | " < > SPACE_CHARACTER_0x20
 * The ASCII control characters
 * The ASCII non-printing characters
 * Any non-ASCII characters (Unicode value > 0xFF)
 
 The constant SSYPercentEscapeStandardRFC3986 means character set
 defined by the union of the following sets:
 * SSYPercentEscapeStandardRFC2396
 * The fifteen characters: ! * ' ( ) ; : @ & = + $ , / ?
