/*!
 @brief    An improved -description, which gives a detailed, multi-line
 description of the error, including all keys and values in the userInfo
 dictionary.
 
 @details  Individual keys and values in the userInfo dictionary, as well
 as the entire description of the userInfo, are truncated in the middle
 to reasonable lengths if they are unreasonably long.
 
 If this category were instead a class, I would instead override
 -description with the implementation of this method.
 
 This method will call itself
 in the event that one of the values in the userInfo dictionary is itself
 an NSError, and this should occur when one of the keys is
 NSUnderlyingErrorKey.&nbsp; The lines in the output string will each
 be indented by several spaces.
 
 To prevent runaway, the keys in the userInfo, values in userInfo, and
 length of the entire output are truncated to non-ridiculous lengths.
 
 If the result is truncated, it will end in SSYDidTruncateErrorDescriptionTrailer.
